# Coured-Perlin-Noise
This Python code was used to create the Perlin noise effect found in the video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-kU0d0fGU

# Required programs

Pygame & Numba are the only required programs

This should be just download and run if you have the installed modules and python already!
If you don't have Python, you can install that here: https://www.python.org/
Then: ``pip install pygame numba``

Enjoy
